* Requirements:
At least

Mail: Version 6.2 (1499)

Mountain Lion: 10.8

* Installation

1. Quit Mail.app
2. Save and unzip the attachment in ~/Library/Mail/Bundles (create the directory if missing)
   Unzipping will return "ReplyWithHeaders.mailbundle" - copy this to ~/Library/Mail/Bundles
3. In the terminal:

   > defaults write com.apple.mail EnableBundles -bool true

4. Start Console.app (/Applications/Utilities)
5. In the search bar (top right corner of Console.app) type: Mail

   This will restrict your information to Mail.app messages
6. Restart Mail.app

In the console, if all goes well, you should see

ReplyWithHeaders: Oh its a wonderful life
